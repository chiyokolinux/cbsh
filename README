cbsh
----

ccsh - chibi shell
a simple shell, written in c

this is a very simple shell,
created to serve as a simple in-between shell
until kaigara is ready.

I built it in an afternoon, so don't expect any
of that full POSIX-compliance or stability

dependencies:
 - readline (optional)
    -> see USE_READLINE flag in config.h

build & install:
$ make
# make install

config:
 - PS1 format
    - %1$s is username
    - %2$s is hostname
    - %3$s is current dir
